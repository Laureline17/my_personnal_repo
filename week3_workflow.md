# Workflow

The practical in week 3 consists to learn how to use the worflow tools. 


## Task workflow

First, we had to join the project created for our group on zube.

The next step was to choose a task and to assign it to yourself.

When I started my task I can put the task in the section "in progress".

With GitHub's Workflow tools,we can see our teamates's work and we can work together on a project without conflicts.

## Reflection

I had some dificulties to do my task so I tried to understand how it works.
And as soon as I understand I will put it on my branch on giyhub so my classmates could have it.
