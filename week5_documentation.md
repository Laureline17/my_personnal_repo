# Documentation

The work for week 5 consists to explain 6 rules of clean code and give some example. 


## First rule

To make sure your code is understandable, you hate to comment it. 
You have to use recognised commenting conventions. They have to be clear and place at the good place.
For example, before a function or next to a complicate part of the code or next to names to describe what they are used for.

```
    // Class for managing the SQLite database for SystemType
    public class SystemTypeDatabase
    {
```

In my code you can see that before coding my class I put a comment to describe why I made it and what it will do. 
My comment is place correctly because it just before what it comments, so people reading my code understand what I am talking about. 
And also my comment is clear, descriptive and not to long. 

## Second rule

Another important rule is to use appropriate names for variables, functions and class. 
It's usefull when you have to read again your code or when someone else have to read it because they have to know what's the variables is made for.
You have to describe what are their functions and use camelCase. 

```
    public class SystemTypeDatabase
    {
````

My class is named "SystemTypeDatabase" so it use appropriate name. In fact it is written in camelCase so it is readable. 
Just with the name you can understand what will the class will be used for. 

## Third rule

To have a clean code you have to make it simple and use the "KISS" rule. KISS stand for "Keep It Simple, Stupid". 
In order to follow this rule you have to avoid complexity that often lead to confusion, bugs, and maintenance difficulties.
The use of the word "stupid" is a reminder that code should not try to be overly clever or complex.

## Fourth rule 

In the continuity of the third rule, you have to not repeat yourself to simplify your code. This rule is named "DRY", "Don't Repeat Yourself". 
The DRY principle is all about minimizing redundancy in your codebase and promoting a more efficient and maintainable software development process.

## Fifth rule

The fifth rule has also for aim to reduce codes. It's "YAGNI" rule witch stand for "You Aint Gonna Need It".
It's a principle that advises developers to avoid adding features or functionality to their codebase until those features are actually needed.
Like that you have a more simple and understable code and also you don't waste your time.


Like you can see on my code, there are no part of my code that it's not used. 

## Sixth rule 

The last rule that I would like to talk about consists in clear and consistent layout and formatting. 
This rule is really important for readability. 
For example you have to make sure that you respect identation, the spacing between elements and other principle.
Sometimes your code works even if you don't respect that rule but if you want to have a clean and understable code you have to respect it. 



This section is related to your work on clean code and documentation in week 5.

First, choose six rules of clean code and explain them. For each one,

* Summarise the rule in your own words.
* Provide an example from the code that you wrote in week 2 and then refined in week 4.
* Explain how your code implements the rule. 

Second, copy the doxygen comments from your code into your portfolio and provide some 
descriptive commentary on their purpose and structure. Use screenshots showing the HTML 
content that is generated from your code to illustrate your explanation.

Finally, highlight three examples from your code where you have eliminated the need
for comments by adhering to the principles of clean code.
